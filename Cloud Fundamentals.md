📘 Cloud Fundamentals  
This repository explains essential cloud and DevOps concepts in a structured and professional manner, suitable for engineers transitioning into cloud-native practices or aiming to build a rock-solid foundational understanding.

---

🧠 DevOps vs. Cloud  
- **Cloud**: Renting compute, storage, and services (e.g., AWS, Azure).  
- **DevOps**: Automation and faster releases using CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code.

---

⚙️ Over-Subscription Explained  
- **Overcommitment**: Allocating more virtual resources than physical capacity.  
- Example: 2 VMs sharing 1 physical server = possible performance issues under load.

---

🏢 On-Prem vs Cloud  
- **On-Premises**: Full control, but high responsibility and cost (CAPEX).  
- **Cloud**: Pay-as-you-go, fast scaling, lower upfront cost (OPEX).

---

🧭 From Data Center to Cloud  
- A traditional data center becomes a cloud when it uses automation and orchestration (e.g., AWS Console, Azure Portal).

---

🆚 AWS Console vs Azure Portal  
| Feature         | AWS Console     | Azure Portal        |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| UI              | Menu-based      | Tile-based          |
| IAM             | AWS IAM         | Azure AD + RBAC     |
| IaC Tools       | CloudFormation, Terraform | Bicep, Terraform |

---

🧪 Agile vs Waterfall vs DevOps  
- **Agile**: Short, fast development cycles  
- **Waterfall**: Step-by-step, linear  
- **DevOps**: Brings automation to Agile with CI/CD

---

🚀 CI/CD Explained  
- **CI**: Auto testing and building on every commit  
- **CD**: Continuous Delivery (manual approval) or Deployment (auto-release)

---

🌐 TCP/IP & Subnetting Basics  
- **CIDR Notation**: /24, /16, etc. define subnet size  
- **Private IP Ranges**:  
  - `10.0.0.0/8`  
  - `172.16.0.0/12`  
  - `192.168.0.0/16`

---

🌐 Web App, Client, Server  
- **Web App**: Hosted code (frontend/backend)  
- **Client**: Browser or device  
- **Server**: Hosts and delivers app content

---

🔀 Middleware Overview  
- Sits between client and server (e.g., API Gateway)  
- Adds security, caching, and authentication (e.g., OAuth)

---

🏗️ Cloud Infrastructure Basics  
| Layer              | Description                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Region             | Geographical area (e.g., us-east-1)  
| Availability Zone  | Isolated zone within a region  
| Edge Location      | For CDN & low-latency access  

---

🔐 VPN vs Direct Connect  
| Feature   | VPN              | Direct Connect        |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Network   | Public Internet  | Private Fiber Line     |
| Security  | Encrypted Tunnel | Dedicated and Secure   |
